# Text-To-Image-Generator
This repository contains a cutting-edge Text-to-Image Generation Model that leverages advanced artificial intelligence techniques to convert textual descriptions into high-quality images.

#Project Overview:
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the ability to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions represents a significant milestone. This capability merges the realms of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to innovative applications that were previously unimaginable. 
This project focuses on harnessing the power of the Stable Diffusion model, an advanced text-to-image generation framework, in combination with GPT-2 for prompt generation. Our aim is to develop a sophisticated pipeline that can transform simple text prompts into detailed and visually coherent images
